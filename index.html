		 	<p class="scenario-text">You've managed to break in to the sacred ritual crypt, where your sources have told you that the artifact you've been searching for might be kept. However, currently you find yourself fleeing down a hallway, pursued by the city guard who were alerted when you missed that last trip wire, sounding the alarm. Amidst the chaos, you seem to have lost your bearings. You dive in to the first room you find with a door, and luckily, manage to get the door closed and a chest pulled in front of it. The pounding on the other side of the door lets you know you don't have a ton of time. You turn around and laugh to yourself at the cliche of finding yourself in a room with four doors to choose from, almost as if you were part of some fantastic story being told... You tell yourself that luck will be on your side and you:</p>

		 	<p class="text-container">Trusting your instincts, you disregard the other three doors, walk up to the tall stone door, and push with all your strength. It grinds open, and as you step through, you find yourself in a small, dimly lit room. The floor and walls are made of stone. As you begin to look around the room, you notice a few things...</p>

		 <div class="result-text" id="result-two">
		 	<p class="text-container">The glimmer of the golden door catches your eye. Knowing in your heart that this is the door you were meant to walk through, you rush up to it and shove it open. Unfortunately, in your haste you didn't bother to check the door for traps, which you realize all too late as the sound of a click is followed by a sharp pain in your chest. You look down to see an arrow jutting from your chest with blood soaking through your shirt around the shaft. "Well, I knew it with my heart, didn't I..."</p>

		 <div class="result-text" id="result-three">
		 	<p class="text-container">Obviously all of these other doors, with their ornate designs and master craftsmanship, were meant to decieve any normal adventurer into believing they were choosing the correct door. But not you, you're too smart for that. You know that if you were going to hide all of the riches, you'd do so behind the least assuming door. You rush up to the basic, gated door, and throw it open, bursting in the room to revel in the riches beyond... And are met with a broom closet. You laugh to yourself, as the sound of wood splintering behind you lets you know that the gaurds have made their way into the room behind you. Well, what a story you'll have for the afterlife, how you found yourself in the richest treasure trove in all the land, and your grand prize was some dirty rags and the end of a sword point. Fitting...</p>
